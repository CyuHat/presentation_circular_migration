## Definition:

-   **Visiting migration**: visiting the country of origin.

-   **Multiple migration**: repeated, secondary, onward, stepwise and serial migration [@steiner_who_2019]

-   **Transnationalism**: becoming firmly rooted in their new country but maintaining simultaneously multiple linkages to their homeland [@steiner_how_2019].

## Impact of Covid-19 travel restriction {auto-animate="true"}

-   **Cross-border mobility virtually impossible [@jarv_impact_2021]**

    -   After border reopeing: Increase of transnational ties with the country of origin

-   **Reduced life satisfaction among migrants [@gerber_life_2022]**

    -   But transnational ties reduced this effect

# Literature Review

## Migration vs mobility {auto-animate="true"}

**Previously**

-   **Migration**: Unique long-term move

-   **Mobility**: Multiple short-term move

## Migration vs mobility {auto-animate="true"}

**Previously**

::: nonincremental
-   **Migration**: Unique long-term move

    -   Undesirable

-   **Mobility**: Multiple short-term move

    -   Acceptable
:::

## Migration vs mobility {auto-animate="true"}

**Today**

-   **Questioning this distinction:**

    -   migration mobility nexus, anchoring, embedding, etc.

-   **Relation blurred**

## Migration vs mobility {auto-animate="true"}

**Today**

-   **Migration Mobility Nexus**: Relationship between migration and mobility as:

    -   **Enablement**: One enable the other

    -   **Continuum**: There is a continuity between them

    -   **Hierarchy**: One is deemed superior or preferable than the other

    -   **Opposition**: One oppose the other

## Migration vs mobility {auto-animate="true"}

-   **Continuum**: The first migration is embedded in the circular mobility between the host country and the country of origin.

-   **Transnationalism**: Ties are maintained

    -   Network: Family & Friends
    -   Attachment
    -   Belonging

# Visiting migration ↔ Transnationalism in Switzerland

## Linking mobility patterns to transnational ties

![](image/chapter%2011.png)

## Core Concepts

-   **Transnationalism**: Simultaneous participation in:
    1.  **Transnational mobility**\
    2.  **Transnational social networks**\
    3.  **Transnational attachment**

## Findings

1.  **Contradict** the idea that **the longer individual stay the less transnational**

2.  **Transnationality is ressource-dependant**: legal capital (EU passport), education capital (Highly skilled)

3.  **Reactive transnationalism** (triggered by marginalization and discrimination), **does not hold** for mobility.

## Five ideal types of *transmigrant* {.scrollable}

::: nonincremental
1.  **Immobile, one‑time migrants** – low moves, high attachment (Southern EU, women).

2.  **Former very‑mobile men, now settled** – high pre‑moves, low current mobility, low attachment (EU/US, high education).

3.  **One‑time migrants now mobile & attached** – low pre‑moves, partner/children abroad, high attachment (women, Asia/LatAm).

4.  **Cosmopolitan, hyper‑mobile, low attachment** – many moves, friends abroad, low attachment (US/UK, high education).

5.  **Hyper‑mobile outsiders** – many moves, low attachment, low education (Western Balkans, low legal capital).
:::

## Why Visiting migration Matters

-   **Pre‑migration mobility**
    -   54 % moved **once‑twice**\
    -   37 % moved **3‑5 times**\
    -   7 % moved **\> 5 times** before arriving in Switzerland.
-   **Post‑migration mobility**
    -   65 % visit origin **≥ once / year**\
    -   18 % visit **monthly** or more.
-   Shows **generalized mobility** beyond the “high‑skill‑expat” narrative.

## Key points

1.  Visiting migration is a continuum

2.  Recently arrived migrants are highly mobile

3.  Need for a proper measure of transnationalism

# **How did the COVID‑19 pandemic reshape Visiting migration?**

## Hypothesis

**H1**: Covid-19 leads to a decrease in Visiting migration

**H2**: Expecting an increase in Visiting migration in 2024

**H3**: A higher transnationality increase Visiting migration

## Methodology {.scrollable}

**DV**: How often have you visited your country of origin?

**IVs**:

-   COVID-19: years
-   transnational types (social & attachment)?
-   Socio-demographics
-   Controls

## Data

**Migration Mobility Survey**

-   Panel with refresh sample

-   **Five waves**: 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024

-   Mean size: \~7'000 individuals

**Sample**: With the years 2018, 2020 and 2022

-   2'117 individuals

-   Risk of further decrease if 2024 wave included

## Model

**Mulilevel bayesian ordinal regression**

-   **Multilevel**: Longitudinal data
-   **Bayesian**: Risk of small dataset
-   **Ordinal**: Dependent variable

# Questions

## Questions {auto-animate="true"}

-   Is the presentation understandable?

-   Which term should I use? (Visiting migration, transnational migration, home visiting)

-   Do the hypothesis make sens?

-   Does the chosen model make sens?

-   Any advice?
